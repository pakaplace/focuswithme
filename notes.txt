Listeners
* messages - listen for speicifc text in slack messages
* events - listen for events in slack like app home opened
* commands - listen for commands in slack like /schedule
* actions - listen for actions in slack like button clicks

Key points:
* All listeners should be async
* Always await ack() for interactive components - tells slack to expect a response, must respond in 3s
* Use say() for channel messages
* Use respond() for ephemeral responses
* Use client for advanced API calls


Can I still use sockets and still distribute apps to thir party teams? 
Yes, Socket Mode works fine with distributed/public Slack apps. The distribution process is exactly the same:
1. Submit app for review
2. Get approved
3. Other teams install via OAuth
Each installation still:
* Gets its own bot token
* Works with the same permissions
* Can use all features
The only limitation is on YOUR side:
* 1 WebSocket connection per app token
* Need to handle multiple team's events through that connection
* Might need multiple instances for high load
